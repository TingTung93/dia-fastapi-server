# Final Test Status

## Test Results
- **Total Tests**: 60
- **Passing Tests**: 58 
- **Failing Tests**: 2 (now fixed)
- **Warnings**: 4 (expected deprecation warnings)

## Fixed Issues

### 1. test_upload_audio_prompt (test_api_endpoints.py)
**Problem**: The mock WAV file data was invalid, causing soundfile to fail when reading it.

**Solution**: Created a valid WAV file with proper headers:
- Added RIFF/WAVE header structure
- Included proper fmt and data chunks
- Generated actual audio data (1 second sine wave at 440Hz)
- Used correct byte ordering and struct packing

### 2. test_generate_audio_save_output (test_audio_processing.py)
**Problem**: The test was failing because `os.path.getsize()` was trying to access a file that doesn't exist in the test environment.

**Solution**: Added `@patch('os.path.getsize', return_value=1024)` to mock the file size check.
