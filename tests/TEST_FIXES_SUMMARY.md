# Test Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the fixes applied to make the test suite match the actual server implementation.

## Key Fixes Applied

### 1. Import Issues
- Added mocking for the `dia` module which is not available in test environment
- Fixed import paths by adding `src` to Python path in pytest.ini
- Created `src/__init__.py` to make src a proper Python package

### 2. API Response Format Fixes
- **Health endpoint**: Removed non-existent `gpu_count` field
- **Async generation**: Changed expected status code from 202 to 200
- **Job endpoints**: Fixed to use actual TTSJob objects instead of Mock objects
- **Config update**: Fixed response format to include both message and config

### 3. Text Preprocessing Logic
- Fixed role mapping: system role now correctly uses S2 (same as assistant)
- Fixed mixed tags test to match actual behavior (no modification when tags exist)

### 4. Removed Tests for Non-Existent Functions
- Removed `TestWorkerAssignment` class entirely
- Removed tests for `generate_tts` function (doesn't exist)
- Removed tests for `get_next_worker_gpu` function (doesn't exist)
- Removed tests for `schedule_job_cleanup` function (doesn't exist)
- Removed OpenAI endpoint tests (endpoints don't exist in server)

### 5. Job Queue and Worker Pool
- Fixed job retention test to handle hardcoded 1-hour retention period
- Fixed worker pool tests to match actual implementation
- Fixed job processing tests to use actual TTSJob objects
- Fixed syntax error in test_job_queue.py (indentation issue)

### 6. Audio Processing
- Added proper mocking for file operations to avoid Windows path issues
- Fixed audio generation tests to match actual function signatures
- Added proper mocking for os.path operations in cleanup tests

### 7. Multi-GPU Tests
- Fixed multi-GPU test to expect RuntimeError when no GPUs available
- Fixed torch compile test to just verify boolean return

## Test Organization

The test suite is now organized into 4 main files:

1. **test_api_endpoints.py** (23 tests)
   - Health and status endpoints
   - Model and voice listing
   - TTS generation (sync/async)
   - Job management
   - Voice mapping management
   - Audio prompt management
   - Configuration management

2. **test_audio_processing.py** (15 tests)
   - Text preprocessing with speaker tags
   - Audio generation with various parameters
   - Job processing workflow
   - Directory and file management

3. **test_job_queue.py** (11 tests)
   - Job model and status transitions
   - Job queue operations
   - Job processing and concurrency
   - Job cleanup and retention

4. **test_worker_pool.py** (11 tests)
   - GPU management and detection
   - Model loading (single/multi-GPU)
   - Worker pool operations
   - Error handling

## Running the Tests

To run the tests, you need to:

1. Activate the conda environment:
   ```bash
   conda activate dia
   ```

2. Install test dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pytest pytest-asyncio
   ```

3. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/ -v -m unit
   ```

All tests should now pass successfully!
